# DecentralizedNameRegistrationSystem
Solidity task: Build a vanity name registering system resistant against frontrunning. An unregistered name can be registered for a certain amount of time by 'locking' a certain balance of an account. After the registration expires, the account loses ownership of the name and their balance is unlocked. The registration can be renewed by making an on-chain call to keep the name registered and balance locked. The fee to register the name depends directly on the size of the name. A malicious node/validator should not be able to front-run the process by censoring transactions of an honest user and registering its name in its own account.
